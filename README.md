# OpenAPI Description Generator

A python library to agnostically generate an OpenAPI Description file, whether you want to define it all at once or throughout whatever framework you wish to use.

The goal is to always target the most up to date version of the OpenAPI specification.

We currently target OAS 3.1.1

`pip install openapi-description-generator`
